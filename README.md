# Ford_Driver_IsAlert_Case_Study
The objective of this challenge is to find whether the driver of this ford car is alert or not employing many combination of vehicular, environmental and driver physiological data that are acquired while driving.The data for this particular challenge is available int his thid webpage https://www.kaggle.com/c/stayalert. One can download the data from this webpage with three files train,test data and sample submission file.

# Process Followed

# Problem Statement
AS stated above this challenge deals about the finding whether the driver of a particular ford car is alert or not based on several features as listed in the data which is avaliable in the kaggle challenge.

# Data Import
Import the train data to the workspace where the analysis is said to be carried out.

# DATA EXPLORATION

Kepping in mind which is the target variable carry out the exploratory abnalysis based on whether the dependent variable is continous or categorical. Follow the general exploratory for continous and categorical then move on to bivariate analysis and explore the continous continous as pair and then continous categorical and categorical continous.

# Model Building
since this a classifier problem go on chossing and fitting the classifier aML algorithm such as Logistic Regression,Decision tree,Random Forest and work on with Neural networks classifer

I have used algorithm classifer which are familiar to be as far as this current time and tried exploring with those and was trying to get accuracy scores.I have attached my analysis code in code folder

Would add in future if exploring new algorithms
